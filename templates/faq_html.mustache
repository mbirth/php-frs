<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<h4>What is this?</h4>

<p>
Some time ago, Google introduced features to highlight special items from your
mails, like hotel reservations, event tickets, car rentals and more.
</p>

<p>
Later, they added features to Google Now on Android smartphones so that you
get notified when to leave to catch your flight or event â€¦ or how to get to
your booked hotel and when the checkin opens.
</p>

<p>
And recently, they even added a feature to Google Search, that shows your
booked items when you search for similar things. All that from a mail in your
inbox.
</p>

<p>
A nice overview with sample images can be found on Google's Developer pages:<br/>

</p>

<p>
But while the needed data is easy to be added to confirmation mails, many
companies didn't do this yet. And sometimes, you don't even get any confirmation
by email. To make those things show up in Google Now, I made this tool.
</p>

<h4>What does it do?</h4>

<p>
You can select a type of reservation, fill in all your details and have it sent to the mail address
of your account. We will add all the neccessary markup to the mail so that Google Now can
recognise it. This will make the events/reservations show up when you need them.
</p>

<h4>What happens to my data?</h4>

<p>
Your data won't be stored on our servers. It is solely used to compose the mail. After the mail is
sent, your data is deleted from our servers.
